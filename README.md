## Description
<ul>
<li>Spectrum Vision (SV) aims to help the visually and/or hearing-impaired to communicate better with their surroundings as well as their loved ones. </li>
<li>SV hopes to eliminate the use of a walking stick and enhance the social experience of its users.   
  Built under $25</li>
</ul>

## How it works
SV comes with many features that allows the visually and deaf people to communicate with surroundings and loved ones.
### Dashboard 
<hr>
<ul>
  <li> The dashboard is a way for caregivers to interact with patients that are either visually impaired or suffer from deafness </li>
  <li> The caregiver can activate 2 modes, the Visual Mode, and Hearing mode, each mode provides different services that are mentioned below </li>
  <li> The dashboard also allows for caregivers to check up on their patients, by finding out the recent places they have visited, emergency contacts, and allergies </li>
</ul>

### Smart Glove Injury Protection
<hr>
<ul>
  <li> We have created a Smart Glove for the Visually impaired, that detects objects that are within 12 CM of the user, as well as detects objects that are over a certain temperature(too hot), and a beep sound is made to notify the user.</li>
</ul>

### Smart Glasses for surroundings Analysis
<hr>
<ul>
  <li> With SV, a virtually impaired user can wear our smart glasses to get analysis of their surroundings </li>
  <li> Our glasses capture pictures of the surroundings, and with computer vision algorithms analyze the content, the content is then converted into speech, and is sent to the user </li>
</ul>

### Communication with caregiver through Sign Language Recognition
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>When hearing mode is activated, a caregiver can interact with a Hearing Impaired person, by communicating through sign language</li>
  <li>We have implemented algorithms that allow for sign language to be translated to English, so that caregivers can understand their patients, and guide them </li>
